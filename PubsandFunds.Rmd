####Abstract 

This chapter discusses what cognition–action trade-offs in infancy reveal about the
organization and developmental trajectory of attention. We focus on internal attention
because this aspect is most relevant to the immediate concerns of infancy, such as fluctuating
levels of expertise, balancing multiple taxing skills simultaneously, learning how
to control attention under variable conditions, and coordinating distinct psychological
domains. Cognition–action trade-offs observed across the life span include perseveration
during skill emergence, errors and inefficient strategies during decision making, and
the allocation of resources when attention is taxed. An embodied cognitive-load
account interprets these behavioral patterns as a result of limited attentional resources
allocated across simultaneous, taxing task demands. For populations where motor
errors could be costly, like infants and the elderly, attention is typically devoted to motor
demands with errors occurring in the cognitive domain. In contrast, healthy young
adults tend to preserve their cognitive performance by modifying their actions.

####Abstract

Research suggests that mind-body techniques are useful for enhancing self-regulatory behaviors, including attention and emotional regulation. The majority of research in this area focuses on adult behavior. However, there has been a growing interest in using mindfulness techniques with children and more recently, in the school setting. Students identified as emotionally disturbed (ED) could potentially benefit from such interventions. In this study, a 12-week mind-body curriculum utilizing mindfulness and game-based biofeedback techniques was implemented in special education emotional support classrooms with elementary and middle school students. A quasi-experimental design was implemented to examine the effects of the mindfulness and biofeedback program on students’ on-task and off-task behaviors in the classroom. Results indicated significant decreases in overall off-task behaviors and improvements that approached significance in on-task behaviors for the participants in the treatment group (n = 14) compared to the participants in the control group (n = 17). The potential benefits of using a mindfulness and biofeedback program with ED students are discussed as well as limitations of the study, implications for practice, and recommendations for future research.
