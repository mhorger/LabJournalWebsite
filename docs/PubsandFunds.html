<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Sleep is part of the process that prepares children and adults for next day cognitive activity. Insufficient or fragmented sleep has a detrimental impact on subsequent encoding (Rouleau et al., 2002) and cognitive functioning (Joo et al., 2012). However, fragmented sleep early in life is a developmental norm, limiting the extent to which conclusions derived from older populations can be generalized. To directly test the continuity of this relationship, newly-walking infants’ (N = 58) sleep was monitored overnight using actigraphy. The next morning they were taught a motor problem-solving task. The task required infants to navigate through a tunnel to reach a goal at the other end. We coded infants’ exploratory behaviors and the extent of training required to solve the task. Using a cluster analysis that accounted for exploratory behaviors and number of training prompts, infants were sorted into 3 profiles: those who found the task Easy to solve, those who found it Difficult, and those who Never solved it. Wake episodes and sleep efficiency were entered as predictors of cluster membership in a multinomial logistic regression. Of the infants who ultimately solved the task, those with more wake episodes and lower sleep efficiency had more difficulty. Specifically, fragmentation appeared to negatively impact preparedness to learn. Contrary to our expectations, infants who Never solved the task had the least fragmented sleep. Implications for the impact of sleep quality on subsequent functioning are discussed, as well as the impact of development in other domains, such as motor skill, on sleep.</p>

<div id="abstract-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>One hundred and six infants with varied independent walking experience faced the problem of navigating a tunnel to reach a caregiver. Solving the task required infants to switch from standing to crawling so they could fit their bodies into the tunnel. Spontaneous exploratory behaviors were documented. Infants who did not immediately go through the tunnel received a strict 15-step training protocol to highlight relevant details of the task. Age and walk experience were entered as predictors into a series of stepwise regressions on measures of exploratory and problem-solving behaviors. In general, older infants were more successful than younger infants in completing the task. A significant nonlinear relationship was documented between walk experience and some outcome measures. Infants with a moderate amount of walk experience had more difficulty than those with very little or a lot. Microgenetically documenting problem solving as a function of experience revealed that attention is taxed during mastery of a motor skill. Availability of attentional resources, in turn, impacted walkers’ exploratory behaviors and ability to maintain problem-solving strategies.</p>

<div id="abstract-2" class="section level4">
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This chapter discusses what cognition–action trade-offs in infancy reveal about the organization and developmental trajectory of attention. We focus on internal attention because this aspect is most relevant to the immediate concerns of infancy, such as fluctuating levels of expertise, balancing multiple taxing skills simultaneously, learning how to control attention under variable conditions, and coordinating distinct psychological domains. Cognition–action trade-offs observed across the life span include perseveration during skill emergence, errors and inefficient strategies during decision making, and the allocation of resources when attention is taxed. An embodied cognitive-load account interprets these behavioral patterns as a result of limited attentional resources allocated across simultaneous, taxing task demands. For populations where motor errors could be costly, like infants and the elderly, attention is typically devoted to motor demands with errors occurring in the cognitive domain. In contrast, healthy young adults tend to preserve their cognitive performance by modifying their actions.</p>

<div id="abstract-3" class="section level4">
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Research suggests that mind-body techniques are useful for enhancing self-regulatory behaviors, including attention and emotional regulation. The majority of research in this area focuses on adult behavior. However, there has been a growing interest in using mindfulness techniques with children and more recently, in the school setting. Students identified as emotionally disturbed (ED) could potentially benefit from such interventions. In this study, a 12-week mind-body curriculum utilizing mindfulness and game-based biofeedback techniques was implemented in special education emotional support classrooms with elementary and middle school students. A quasi-experimental design was implemented to examine the effects of the mindfulness and biofeedback program on students’ on-task and off-task behaviors in the classroom. Results indicated significant decreases in overall off-task behaviors and improvements that approached significance in on-task behaviors for the participants in the treatment group (n = 14) compared to the participants in the control group (n = 17). The potential benefits of using a mindfulness and biofeedback program with ED students are discussed as well as limitations of the study, implications for practice, and recommendations for future research.</p>
